Slide deck of presentation "**Rapid Web Application Development with Groovy & Ratpack**" given at **Javaland** (Brühl), *2015* by *Andrey Adamovich*.

Presentation description:

> Ratpack is yet another kid in the block of web application development frameworks. Why is it different? It gives you an ability of rapid prototyping of web UIs and APIs. Non-blocking implementation, which includes testing, dependency injection, monitoring, streaming are all (as well as many others) built-in features and are easy to use. You can start as small as a single script, or split your application into several source code files organically when it grows bigger. Also, the conciseness of Groovy programming language and elegant API gives it an outstanding charm that's worth a try for your next small or big project. This presentation gives a demo of how to quickly create a web application with Ratpack.
